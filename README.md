# ColorReplacer
This project lets you input a .ppm image and a predefined palette of colors. 
The program then runs and will look at each pixel and find the closest color to the ones in your palette 
and then print out the image now recolored to the closest colors. 
*This project was the final project in the first module of my accelerated program*

This program is run and compiled in a command terminal.
What isn't provided, and you will need to import to run, is a .ppm file of your choosing.
